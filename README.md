# Stonecroft Bees

Stonecroft Bees will be a website for a commercial beekeeping business; which sells bee products, such as honey and beeswax, and beekeeping supplies, such as hives, tools, and books.

The site will be a full featured e-commerce site, allowing both registered and unregistered purchases by customers, and the site admin to administrate products and users, and manage stock levels.

A demo for the site can be found hosted on Heroku at [https://ak87-milestone4.herokuapp.com/](https://ak87-milestone4.herokuapp.com/)

## UX

### Intended Audience

The site will be intended to be used by customers, both unregistered and registered, to allow them to view products, add products to a shopping basket, and make purchases using Stripe. Registered users will also be able to make a profile to view their previous orders, and store their address and contact information etc to make checking out quicker.

Site Owners will be able to manage user profiles, add product information, and view and manage stock levels, and view and manage outstanding orders.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### A secure login system (provided by allauth) to:
- Register for accounts, login/out, handle emails for confirmation and password resets
- User Profiles to:
  - store their contact and delivery information, to prefill forms with for convenience
  - maintain an order history

#### A navbar which provides easy access on any page to:
- Login/Register/View User Profile
- Frequent admin functions
- Shopping cart with a display of the current total
- Search products
- Access product categories
- Access the contact systems

#### A Product Database which:
- Stores details of Products sold such as name, category, etc
- Has Product Lines for different colour varieties of products or bulk casings
  - Each line allows it's own price and name, and tracks its own stock levels
- Products list display which displays products filtered by category and allows sorting by various options
- Product details which present the image, name, price etc of the product and its lines to the customers
- Makes use of Django Admin pages to manage creating and editing of products/lines
- Product/Lines soft delete via a '***_discontinued' field, to maintain data integrity and references with order history, etc

#### Stock Keeping:
- Each Product has Product Lines which track the quantity in stock and the amount of stock reserved
- When a customer completes an order stock is reserved on that Line
- The available stock (Quantity - Reserved) is checked at various points to ensure customer can not buy more than is available
  - Product Details: 
    - The available stock is passed to the selector and displayed for the customer
    - This is passed to the quantity selector, which uses it to set its max levels
  - Bag: 
    - Checked when adding to bag, or adjusting current quantity
    - When viewing bag, JavaScript highlights the fields which have more selected than available
  - Checkout: 
    - Once as a pre-check before the user sees the form, returns them to Bag screen to make adjustments if needed
    - When purchase submitted a final penultimate check is made during order creation (or backup Webhook)
      - This is for the very rare instances that someone has bought the stock between the time the customer enters the checkout and submits the purchase
      - In this case the payment intent is cancelled so the user isn't charged, and the customer is returned to the bag page with error details

#### Bag
- Bag total is visible on every page via a navbar element
- Provides a page for the customer to:
  - view items in their bag
  - alter the quantity of items in the bag
  - remove items from the bag
- Validates that quantity selected is actually available (see Stock Keeping.3)

#### Checkout 
- Uses the Stripe payment system to provide safe and secure checking out
- Allows purchases by both registered and unregistered customers
- Orders are stored in the database
- Uses Stripe Webhooks to create Order record if something goes wrong between the customer purchasing the order and the backend creating the order
- Payment Intents are deferred until Ordered created on DB either via POST backend or Webhook
- Orders have a status:
  - Processing - when order is initially created on DB
  - Pending - set once Webhook has been received to confirm payment successfully
  - Picking - order has been sent for picking in warehouse (FOR FUTURE USE)
  - Dispatched - order has been dispatched to customer (FOR FUTURE USE)
  - Cancelled - Order has been cancelled (FOR FUTURE USE)
- Customer receives email to confirm order

#### Contact
- Provides a contact form for general enquiries
- Provides a contact form for reporting bee swarms
- Both send email receipt to submitter
- Swarms sends email to specified email address (likely an email address group) with details of the swarm
- Messages are stored in the database for future use

### Features Left to Implement

For following User Stories were cut for time, but would be good to implement later:

| ID  | As A/An    | I want to...                                                      | So I can...                                                                           |

| 27  | Site Owner | Automatically have reserved stocked unmarked when order cancelled | Allow that stock to be re-available for purchase by other shoppers                    |
| 28  | Site Owner | Stock to subtract when order marked as dispatched                 | Have stock levels on system match stock levels in warehouse                           |
| 29  | Site Owner | Get a printable invoice                                           | So I know what items to pick for an order                                             |

#### Future Ideas
##### Stock Reservation
As currently implemented the focus was primary a defensive one to prevent customers trying to purchase more stock than available.  
Although this was implemented with the intent of also giving a good User Experience, there is still room for improvement.

Specifically the final checkout check, which occurs after the customer has already entered their payment information and confirmed the purchase, 
this could be annoying (and concerning) to the customer (though should be rare after the previous checks, and the customer isn't actually charged).

A better system would probably have some sort of soft reservations when a user adds the item to their bag, 
but this would need to make a system to clear or expire those reservations when the user abandons the purchase. 

##### Stock Control / Ordering
The current system is baby steps, it tracks the quantity in the warehouse and updates the amount reserved when purchased.  
But a full system would need to create picking tickets, track when dispatched, and allow the user to cancel their order and return the stock to the available pool.

##### User Profile
There's currently no way for the user to set their name fields, this would be highly useful for a full program.

##### Custom admin pages
To save time I made use of Django's built in admin panel system to create forms to manage database tables, 
they are highly functional and get the job done, but do take the user away from the main site. Even if they are 
a staff user, it would still be a better experience to have customised admin pages that match the rest of the site.

##### Automated Testing
Automated tests have been implemented for the Home, Products, and Contact app, but are still to do for the Bag, Checkout, and Profiles apps - though they have been manually tested.

##### Product images
The products list grid display can go a little wonky if pictures are used which do not have square dimensions.
A solution of course is to only use images with square dimensions for product images, but a better one
would be to implement something like [django-image-cropping](https://github.com/jonasundderwolf/django-image-cropping),
which allows a site admin to upload an image of any size but be able to choose which part of it to crop.

## Testing

Testing documentation is located in a separate [TESTING.md document](docs/TESTING.md) located in the docs folder.

## Deployment

### Remarks
There are two git branches:
  - Master: the dev branch
  - Live: the live branch

The dev branch is used for development and is considered unstable.  
The live branch is used for deployments to heroku, and is considered stable.  
At time of submission these should match codewise, if they don't then I am very very silly.  
The only differences should be is that the Live deployment uses an external Postgres DB instead of a local SQLlite,  
the media and static files are hosted externally on AWS, and actual emails are sent instead of console prints.

There are no config files to change, all custom settings are managed through environment variables.

### Heroku Deployment

#### Predeployment 

- Create a fork of the Stonecroft Bee's github repo
- Create a public S3 Bucket on Amazon Web Services (consult AWS's manual for how to do this)
  - Download the 'new_user_credentials.csv' to a safe place after making the user
- Set up an email service that allows SMTP outgoing mail, e.g. Gmail 
  - Create an address for general outgoing/incoming mail (the contact address)
  - Create an mailing list address for the Swarms service
- Create a Stripe Account
  - Create a webhook to '[Herokuapp Address]/checkout/wh/'  
    (e.g. 'https://ak87-milestone4.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/')

#### Heroku

- Create a new app

- Deploy
  - Deployment Method: Github
  - Connect to your Github fork for the Stonecroft Bees repo
  - Manual Deployment: Choose Live branch
  - (Optional) Set up automatic deployments from Live branch 
- Heroku CLI Run (or Web Interface > Other > Run Console), in order:
  1. Python3 manage.py migrate
  2. Python3 manage.py loaddata OrderStatus
  3. Python3 manage.py loaddata Category
  4. (Optional) Python3 manage.py loaddata Sample_ProductInfo
  5. (Optional) Python3 manage.py loaddata Sample_ProductStock
  6. Python3 manage.py createsuperuser

#### Post Deployment

- The Static files will have been collected and pushed the S3 bucket during the build (check build logs for success)
- The Media files will not, copy these to a 'media' folder in the root of the S3 bucket manually through the AWS S3 web interface or cli
- Go to [HEROKU_HOSTNAME]/admin/ and log in with the created Super User
  - Accounts: Emails Addresses: 
    - Check email for super user exists, if not add it
    - Check 'Verified' and 'Primary' are ticked
  - Sites: Sites:
    - Change example.com
      - Domain name: The [HEROKU_HOSTNAME]
      - Display name: Something friendly, e.g. Stonecroft Bees


### Local Deployment

Assuming this is to run without an external DB, S3 Bucket, or functional email system: 

#### Predeployment 

- Create a fork of the Stonecroft Bee's github repo
- Create a Stripe Account
  - Create a webhook to '[Herokuapp Address]/checkout/wh/'  
    (e.g. 'https://ak87-milestone4.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/')

#### Local Enviroment
- Clone forked repo to local environment
- Only the following environment variables are required:
  - DEVELOPMENT - set to 'True' (remember: case sensitive!) or static/media files won't be served
  - SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_WH_SECRET 
- Run the following, in order:
  1. Python3 manage.py migrate
  2. Python3 manage.py loaddata OrderStatus
  3. Python3 manage.py loaddata Category
  4. (Optional) Python3 manage.py loaddata Sample_ProductInfo
  5. (Optional) Python3 manage.py loaddata Sample_ProductStock
  6. Python3 manage.py createsuperuser

#### Post Deployment
- Go to [LOCAL_HOST]/admin/ and log in with the created Super User
  - Accounts: Emails Addresses: 
    - Check email for super user exists, if not add it
    - Check 'Verified' and 'Primary' are ticked
