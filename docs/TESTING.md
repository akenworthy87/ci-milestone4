# TESTING

## Method

Testing was carried out manually throughout the development process, when the project was 
feature complete another pass of manual testing was carried out.  
Automated tests were written towards the end as a demonstrative proof of concept.


---------
## Automated Tests

Automated tests have been written to cover the Home, Products, and Contact apps.  
Coverage was used to check the tests covered the most of the major components of these apps.
The Bag, Checkout, Profile apps do not currently have automated tests written for them.

To run the tests simply execute: python3 manage.py test

## Issues of Note

### Stripe Payments
Although not an issue per se, the way we were taught Stripe Payments was to have the 
Payment Intent automatically charge the customer's card.  
This caused an issue for my design as I intended to have a final stock check as the order 
was finalised, either by the POST view or through the backup method triggered by the web hook.  
Going via the taught method I would have to issue refunds to the Payment Intent, which was 
not a viable solution from a business perspective due to Stripe's transaction fees not being 
refunded to the business.

After researching and reading Stripe's manual I found I could change the Payment Intent 
to hold capturing the charge until later.  
This allowed me to run additional validation after the payment was authorised, if issues were 
found then the Payment Intent could be cancelled in full without causing charges 
to the customer or transaction fees to the business.

This was set to capture the charge once the order record was generated, but could be
set to capture at a later point, e.g. when the goods are dispatched from the warehouse - 
which a lot of retail companies do.

## Other Browsers

Development was done using Chrome. 

The other browsers I checked the site with were: Firefox, Opera, Edge, and Chrome for Android.  
There were no noticeable differences in appearance between the browsers.  

I did briefly look at IE to confirm how broke it looked, and it looks like the CSS vars don't load 
so the backgrounds aren't coloured correctly.  
IE isn't a supported browser any more so I won't be fixing it.


---------
## Remarks

The products list grid display can go a little wonky if pictures are used which do not have square dimensions.
A solution of course is to only use images with square dimensions for product images, but a better one
would be to implement something like [django-image-cropping](https://github.com/jonasundderwolf/django-image-cropping),
which allows a site admin to upload an image of any size but be able to choose which part of it to crop.
